## Deployment

### One-Click Deploy to Railway

The fastest way to get started is deploying to Railway with a single click:

[![Deploy on Railway](https://railway.com/button.svg)](https://railway.com/deploy/EATit9?referralCode=EnYHPz&utm_medium=integration&utm_source=template&utm_campaign=generic)

This will automatically:

- ‚úÖ Deploy frontend and backend services
- ‚úÖ Provision PostgreSQL and Redis databases
- ‚úÖ Configure environment variables

**Important:**

- ‚ö†Ô∏è Custom domains must be configured manually in Railway settings
- üîê Change the default admin password immediately after deployment

---

## Redis Usage Guidelines

Redis is **completely optional** with automatic graceful degradation. The system works perfectly without Redis.

### üéØ **What Uses Redis?**

When Redis is available, these features use it for better performance:

1. **URL Query Cache** - Faster redirects (300ms ‚Üí 10-20ms)
2. **Token Blacklist** - Shared across multiple instances (logout sync)
3. **Rate Limiting** - Accurate throttling across instances

### üîÑ **Automatic Fallback (No Redis Configuration)**

If `REDIS_HOST` is not set, the system automatically uses fallback mechanisms:

| Feature             | Without Redis                | Impact                           |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| **URL Cache**       | Disabled (direct DB queries) | Slower redirects, higher DB load |
| **Token Blacklist** | In-memory Map                | Works in single instance only    |
| **Rate Limiting**   | In-memory Map                | Works in single instance only    |

**System Status:** Fully functional, just slower for high traffic.

### ‚ùå **Skip Redis (< 10K daily clicks)**

**Perfect for:**

- Personal use or small team tools
- Development/testing environments
- Budget-constrained early stage
- Single-instance deployments

**Metrics:**

- Traffic: < 10,000 clicks/day (~0.12 QPS)
- Peak concurrency: < 10 requests/second

**Benefits:**

- ‚úÖ Lower infrastructure costs (~$5-10/month)
- ‚úÖ Simpler maintenance (one less service)
- ‚úÖ No Redis configuration needed

### ‚úÖ **Use Redis (> 50K daily clicks)**

**Recommended for:**

- Marketing campaigns with traffic spikes
- Frequent analytics page views
- Popular URLs (20% URLs = 80% traffic)
- Multi-instance deployments

**Metrics:**

- Traffic: > 50,000 clicks/day (~0.6 QPS)
- Peak concurrency: > 20 requests/second

**Performance boost:**

- Redirect time: 300ms ‚Üí 10-20ms
- Database load: -70% to -90%
- Can handle 10-100x traffic
- Logout syncs across all instances

**Cost:** ~$15-25/month (5-10x performance improvement)

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Redis Strongly Recommended (> 1M daily clicks)**

**Essential for:**

- SaaS products or high-traffic services
- Multi-instance production deployments
- Services requiring guaranteed rate limiting

**Metrics:**

- Traffic: > 1,000,000 clicks/day (~12 QPS)
- Peak concurrency: > 100 requests/second

**Risk without Redis:**

- Database becomes bottleneck
- Degraded user experience
- Rate limiting per instance (not global)

### üìä **How to Decide**

Monitor these metrics:

- **DB query time** > 200ms ‚Üí Consider Redis
- **Redirect response** > 500ms ‚Üí Need optimization
- **Same URL** queried > 10 times/hour ‚Üí Cache helps
- **Multiple instances** ‚Üí Need Redis for sync

### üöÄ **Railway Deployment**

**Option A: Without Redis (Simple & Cheap)**

1. Don't add Redis service
2. Don't set `REDIS_HOST` environment variable
3. System uses automatic fallback
4. Cost: ~$5-10/month

**Option B: With Redis (Performance)**

1. Add Redis service in Railway
2. Environment variables auto-configured:
   ```
   REDIS_HOST=${{Redis.RAILWAY_PRIVATE_DOMAIN}}
   REDIS_PORT=${{Redis.REDISPORT}}
   REDIS_PASSWORD=${{Redis.REDISPASSWORD}}
   ```
3. System automatically detects and uses Redis
4. Cost: ~$15-25/month

**Switch anytime:** Add or remove Redis without code changes. The system automatically adapts.

## ü§ñ AI Assistant Integration (MCP)

Manage your short URLs through AI assistants using the Model Context Protocol (MCP) integration.

### What is MCP?

The [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) is an open standard that enables AI applications to securely connect to external tools and data sources. Our MCP server allows AI assistants like Claude Desktop, Cursor, and Windsurf to manage your short URLs through natural conversation.

### Installation

Install the MCP server globally:

```bash
npm install -g @open-short-url/mcp
```

### Configuration

Configure your MCP client (e.g., Claude Desktop) with:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "open-short-url": {
      "command": "open-short-url-mcp",
      "env": {
        "API_URL": "https://your-backend.com",
        "API_KEY": "ak_your_api_key_here"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### What You Can Do

Once configured, you can ask your AI assistant to:

- "Create a short URL for https://example.com with custom slug 'promo'"
- "Show me all short URLs from this month"
- "Generate a QR code for my short URL abc123"
- "What are the click statistics for my campaign URLs?"
- "Create a bundle called 'Summer Campaign' and add these URLs..."
- "Set up A/B testing with 50/50 traffic split"

### Available Features

The MCP server provides 29 tools across:

- URL Management (create, list, update, delete, QR codes)
- Bundle Management (organize URLs into collections)
- Analytics (detailed click tracking and statistics)
- A/B Testing (create and manage URL variants)

## Webhook Verification Guide

Open Short URL uses **HMAC-SHA256** signature mechanism to ensure webhook delivery security. Recipients must verify the signature to ensure requests are from your server.

### üìã Verification Steps

The system includes an HMAC-SHA256 signature in the `X-Webhook-Signature` header of each webhook request. Here's how to verify it:

```javascript
const crypto = require('crypto');
const express = require('express');

function verifyWebhookSignature(request, secret) {
  // 1. Get signature from header
  const receivedSignature = request.headers['x-webhook-signature'];

  // 2. Read raw request body (must be complete JSON string)
  const payload = JSON.stringify(request.body);

  // 3. Recalculate signature using the same secret and algorithm
  const expectedSignature = crypto
    .createHmac('sha256', secret)
    .update(payload)
    .digest('hex');

  // 4. Use timing-safe comparison to prevent timing attacks
  return crypto.timingSafeEqual(
    Buffer.from(receivedSignature, 'hex'),
    Buffer.from(expectedSignature, 'hex')
  );
}

// Express.js usage example
const app = express();

app.post('/webhook', express.json(), (req, res) => {
  const secret = process.env.WEBHOOK_SECRET; // Your configured webhook secret

  // Verify signature
  if (!verifyWebhookSignature(req, secret)) {
    return res.status(401).json({ error: 'Invalid signature' });
  }

  // Get event information
  const event = req.headers['x-webhook-event'];
  const deliveryId = req.headers['x-webhook-delivery-id'];
  const attempt = req.headers['x-webhook-attempt'];

  // Process webhook event
  console.log('Event:', event);
  console.log('Delivery ID:', deliveryId);
  console.log('Attempt:', attempt);
  console.log('Data:', req.body.data);

  // Respond with success (2xx status code)
  res.status(200).json({ received: true });
});

app.listen(3000);
```

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

1. **JSON Serialization**
   - Must use the same JSON serialization as the sender (no whitespace)
   - Don't add formatting parameters when using `JSON.stringify()`

2. **Raw Request Body**
   - Use raw body: don't modify request body before verification
   - Ensure body parser handles JSON correctly

3. **Timing-Safe Comparison**
   - Use `crypto.timingSafeEqual()` to prevent timing attacks
   - Don't use `===` or `==` to compare signatures

4. **Additional Headers**
   - `X-Webhook-Event`: Event type (e.g., `url.created`, `url.clicked`)
   - `X-Webhook-Delivery-Id`: Delivery ID (for idempotency checks to avoid duplicate processing)
   - `X-Webhook-Attempt`: Retry count (1-3, system automatically retries failed deliveries)

5. **Response Requirements**
   - Must respond within 10 seconds
   - Respond with 2xx status code for success
   - Non-2xx status codes will trigger retry mechanism (up to 3 times)
